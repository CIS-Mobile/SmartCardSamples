Smart Card Reader Samples

These were tested with an Identiv uTrust 3700 F and the HostCardEmulator
app here: https://github.com/CIS-Mobile/HostCardEmulator

The C and Python samples use pcsc-lite and were tested on Ubuntu, while
the Java sample uses the javax.smartcardio library and was tested on both
macOS and Ubuntu.

To install pcsc-lite on ubuntu:
$ sudo apt install libpcsclite-dev

The python-pcsclite wrapper can be found here:
https://sourceforge.net/projects/python-pcsclite/
and can be installed with:
$ sudo apt install ./python3-pcsclite_0.18-1_amd64.deb
